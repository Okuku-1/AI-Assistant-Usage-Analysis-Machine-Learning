# AI Assistant Usage Among Students ðŸ“Š

This project analyzes a dataset of **10,000 records** capturing how students from different academic levels and disciplines use an AI assistant in their studies. Each record represents a single AI usage session with details on demographics, session activity, and outcomes.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Student Demographics**: `StudentLevel`, `Discipline`
- **Session Characteristics**: `SessionLengthMin`, `TotalPrompts`, `TaskType`, `AI_AssistanceLevel`
- **Outcomes**: `FinalOutcome`, `UsedAgain`, `SatisfactionRating`

This makes it useful for exploring:
- Who is using AI (student levels & disciplines)
- How they are using it (task types, prompts, session lengths)
- What results they achieve (outcomes, satisfaction, reuse behavior)

## ðŸ”Ž Analyses Performed
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Data loading, structure, missing values, and summary statistics  
  - Distribution of session lengths and prompts  
  - Breakdown of AI usage by discipline and student level  

- **Behavioral Insights**  
  - Task type preferences (studying, coding, writing, etc.)  
  - Relationship between session length, number of prompts, and outcomes  
  - Satisfaction trends and likelihood of reusing the AI  

- **Potential Machine Learning Applications**  
  - Predicting student satisfaction ratings  
  - Modeling AI usage habits  
  - Clustering students by behavior and outcomes  
  - Trend analysis of academic AI adoption  

---

## âœ… Key Insights
- AI usage varies significantly across disciplines (STEM vs non-STEM).  
- Higher satisfaction and reuse rates are associated with longer, more interactive sessions.  
- Different student levels adopt AI differently (e.g., undergraduates vs graduates).  
- Clear potential for predictive modeling and clustering.
